Hi, I’m @vazakeft 👋
I’m interested in learning to write programs and learn about computers 👀
I’m currently learning to get the CompTIA A+ certification, programming in C, a bit of OpenBSD web server hosting, and much more 🌱 
I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems cool. I like customization and ricing my Linux window manager. 💞️
You can reach me at daniel.neustadter@protonmail.com 📫
